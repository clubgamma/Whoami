## About me
Hello,

I'm Gabriele Fedi.

I have a degree in computer science and I am currently doing an apprenticeship at EDB in order to contribute to the opensource world of postgres.

Gabriele loves computer science and software engineering. He started experimenting with this science as a teenager, attending some courses in the early years of high school. He continues his studies at the University of Florence, graduating with full marks and honors.
After a few years of work experience in web development, most of which parallel to academic courses, he began to appreciate the open source world and the community around PostgreSQL.
He was thrilled to try something other than web development, deciding to apply for this team. Now he can't wait to start his training in order to acquire the necessary skills to make his contribution to the team.
In his spare time he loves hanging out with friends, playing cards and traveling as much as possible. He loves good food and red wine too! He currently lives with his parents in Pistoia, Tuscany.

Hope you enjoyed my intro.

Thank You
