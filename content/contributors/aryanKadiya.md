## About me
Hello All,

I'm Aryan Kadiya.

My name is Aryan Kadiya and pursing my Bachelor’s Degree from Charotar University of Science and Technology and currently studying in Third year. I like knowing about human psychology and philosophy.


Here is one poem by Joyce Alcantara which I find very inspiring:


*You may see me struggle,\
but you won't see me fall.\
Regardless if I'm weak or not,\
I'm going to stand tall.\
Everyone says life is easy,\
but truly living it is not.\
Times get hard,\
people struggle\
and constantly get put on the spot.\
I'm going to wear the biggest smile,\
even though I want to cry.\
I'm going to fight to live,\
even though I'm destined to die.\
And even though it's hard\
and I may struggle through it all,\
you may see me struggle...\
but you will NEVER see me fall.* 







Have a nice day friend.
