I like knowing about human psychology and philosophy.\nHere is one poem by Joyce Alcantara which I find very inspiring:\n You may see me struggle, but you won\u0026rsquo;t see me fall. Regardless if I\u0026rsquo;m weak or not, I\u0026rsquo;m going to stand tall. Everyone says life is easy, but truly living it is not. Times get hard, people struggle and constantly get put on the spot. I\u0026rsquo;m going to wear the biggest smile, even though I want to cry. I\u0026rsquo;m going to fight to live, even though I\u0026rsquo;m destined to die. And even though it\u0026rsquo;s hard and I may struggle through it all, you may see me struggle\u0026hellip; but you will NEVER see me fall.  Have a nice day friend.\nYou can find me at\n YouTube LinkedIn Github Gmail  Thank You\n"

I love eating chocolates.\nSo on that note let me share with you guys one sweet poem on chocolates:\n  Chocolate is sweet  and so good to eat.  I like it whenever  I need a good treat.  In brownies and cookies  and chocolate cake,  it adds extra sweetness  to everything you bake.  White chocolate. dark chocolate  and milk chocolate galore,  I know I could eat 100 pieces or more!  That is for sure ;)\n  Thank You\n"
